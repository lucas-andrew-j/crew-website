			<div><p class="dark">OAE needs financial support to do the work that we do. We need to purchase
				gear. We need to pay for access permits, for food and transportation on our events, or
				sometimes for guide services. There's also Scouting America membership fees, liability
				insurance, and more.</p>
				<p class="dark">We aim to lower the financial barrier of entry into mountaineering and other
					high adventure activities. We will never turn away an otherwise prepared youth because they
					can't pay for a trip, but we need your help to do that.</p>
				<p class="dark">Every dollar helps, and every penny we receive will go directly into our
					program.</p>
